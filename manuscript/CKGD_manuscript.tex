\begin{abstract}
We present Covariant Kinetic Geometrodynamics (CKGD), a theoretical framework based on the BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation of Einstein's equations, proposing that phenomena attributed to dark matter and dark energy arise from the proper accounting of kinetic energy storage in spacetime's extrinsic curvature. Central to this framework is the Lorentz-Projection (LP) metric, which posits that the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ represents geometric shearing of the spacetime foliation rather than relativistic mass increase. Operating entirely within General Relativity without introducing new particles or scalar fields, we derive quantitative predictions for: (1) spacecraft flyby anomalies via Earth's rotational coupling to extrinsic curvature, correctly predicting five Earth flyby missions using exact trajectory data with no free parameters; (2) galactic rotation curves through pure tensor BSSN dynamics, where shear advection balances self-interaction to naturally yield logarithmic conformal potentials, flat rotation profiles, and the Tully-Fisher relation $M \propto v^4$; (3) the Bullet Cluster mass distribution via vacuum shear advection, predicting the spatial offset (107 kpc) and lensing mass ratio (15.4); and (4) a novel testable prediction for exoplanetary system architecture as a function of stellar rotation (the ``Kraft Break'' correlation), driven by a geometric viscosity scaling as $\nu_{\text{vac}} \propto \Omega_*^2$. We demonstrate that CKGD is compatible with Solar System precision tests through Geometric Screening via the Static Vacuum Limit: in non-expanding, static metrics ($K=0$), BSSN shear evolution shuts down, collapsing the Hamiltonian constraint precisely to the Schwarzschild solution. Finally, we resolve thermodynamic paradoxes using Noether's Theorem: global energy is not conserved because the expanding universe ($K>0$) lacks a global timelike Killing vector, allowing cosmological expansion to perform continuous $P dV$ work on the vacuum shear. CKGD provides a unified, parameter-free geometric explanation for phenomena across diverse cosmological scales.

\section{Introduction}

The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model successfully describes the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe through the introduction of cold dark matter (CDM) and dark energy ($\Lambda$). While this model achieves remarkable agreement with observations, it introduces fundamental entitiesâconstituting 95\% of the universe's energy budgetâthat have no direct detection despite decades of experimental effort.

Simultaneously, precision tests in the Solar System reveal subtle anomalies that challenge standard General Relativity (GR) calculations. The Anderson flyby anomalies \cite{Anderson2008}, showing unexplained velocity changes of Earth-grazing spacecraft at the mm/s level, remain unresolved. Galactic rotation curves persistently deviate from Newtonian predictions based on visible matter \cite{Rubin1980}. The Bullet Cluster's apparent separation of gravitational mass from baryonic matter \cite{Clowe2006} provides what many consider definitive evidence for dark matter, yet the quantitative details of this separation have received limited theoretical attention beyond qualitative interpretation.

This work proposes an alternative interpretation: these phenomena emerge from the systematic underestimation of kinetic energy contributions to spacetime curvature in weak-field, low-acceleration regimes. We formalize this through Covariant Kinetic Geometrodynamics (CKGD), built upon the BSSN formulation of Einstein's equationsâa framework originally developed for numerical relativity that naturally separates geometry into volume and shape (traceless extrinsic curvature $\tilde{A}_{ij}$) degrees of freedom.

The central innovation is the \textbf{Lorentz-Projection (LP) metric} hypothesis: kinetic energy is stored not in objects themselves (as "relativistic mass") but in the extrinsic curvature of spacetime's foliation. Different observers choosing different foliations measure different $K_{ij}$, leading to frame-dependent effective energy densities that standard weak-field expansions systematically neglect.

\section{The BSSN Formalism and Pure Tensor Dynamics}

\subsection{Conformal Decomposition}

The Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation \cite{BaumgarteShapiro1999} decomposes the 4-metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ into a spatial 3-metric $\gamma_{ij}$ and extrinsic curvature $K_{ij}$. The critical conformal decomposition separates volume and shape degrees of freedom:
\begin{align}
\gamma_{ij} &= \psi^4 \tilde{\gamma}_{ij}, \quad \det(\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}) = 1 \\
K_{ij} &= \psi^4 \tilde{A}_{ij} + \frac{1}{3}\gamma_{ij}K
\end{align}
where $\psi$ is the conformal factor, $\tilde{\gamma}_{ij}$ is the conformal metric, $\tilde{A}_{ij}$ is the traceless conformal extrinsic curvature ($\tilde{A}^i_i = 0$), and $K = K^i_i$ is the trace of the extrinsic curvature.

\subsection{Evolution and Constraint Equations}

The complete BSSN system governs the dynamic evolution of spacetime. The evolution of the trace-free shear is:
\begin{multline}
\partial_t \tilde{A}_{ij} + \beta^k \nabla_k \tilde{A}_{ij} = \psi^{-4}\left[-\tilde{D}_i\tilde{D}_j\alpha + \alpha\tilde{R}_{ij}\right]^{TF} \\
+ \alpha\left(K\tilde{A}_{ij} - 2\tilde{A}_{ik}\tilde{A}^k_j\right)
\label{eq:A_tilde_evolution}
\end{multline}
where $\alpha$ is the lapse function, $\beta^i$ is the shift vector, and $[\cdot]^{TF}$ denotes the trace-free projection.

The geometry is bound by the Hamiltonian constraint. In a vacuum ($\rho = 0$), this constraint is:
\begin{equation}
8\tilde{\nabla}^2 \psi - \psi\tilde{R} + \psi^5(\tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij}) - \frac{2}{3}\psi^5 K^2 = 0
\label{eq:hamiltonian_conformal}
\end{equation}

In standard weak-field GR, the self-interaction term $(-2\tilde{A}_{ik}\tilde{A}^k_j)$ and the advection term $(\beta^k \nabla_k \tilde{A}_{ij})$ are discarded as negligible second-order corrections. CKGD explicitly retains these terms, as their non-linear feedback loops dictate the structure of spacetime at galactic scales. The kinetic energy density of the vacuum is defined by the tensor contraction:
\begin{equation}
\rho_{\text{kin}} \equiv \frac{c^4}{16\pi G}\tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij}
\label{eq:rho_kinetic}
\end{equation}

\section{Thermodynamics and Noether's Theorem in BSSN}
\label{sec:thermo}

A persistent theoretical critique of any mechanism claiming to generate anomalous geometric momentum or sustain a galactic shear halo is the apparent violation of the Conservation of Energy and Momentum. CKGD formally resolves this paradox by appealing to Noether's Theorem in a cosmological context.

Emmy Noether's theorem dictates that global conservation laws exist if and only if the spacetime possesses continuous symmetries. Specifically, the conservation of total energy requires time-translation invariance (the existence of a global timelike Killing vector field). 

We exist in an expanding Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. The spacetime metric is explicitly time-dependent ($\partial_t g_{\mu\nu} \neq 0$). Consequently, the universe lacks a global timelike Killing vector field. Therefore, \textbf{global energy is not a conserved quantity in General Relativity}.

Instead, GR strictly enforces \textit{local covariant conservation}: $\nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} = 0$. The covariant derivative incorporates the Christoffel symbols, representing the dynamic geometry of spacetime. Matter and local geometries can gain or lose energy provided they exchange it with the global cosmic expansion.

In the BSSN formulation, this thermodynamic exchange is explicitly encoded. Examining the shear evolution equation (Eq. \ref{eq:A_tilde_evolution}), we identify two critical non-linear terms governing the vacuum energy:
\begin{equation}
\partial_t \tilde{A}_{ij} = \dots + \underbrace{K\tilde{A}_{ij}}_{\text{Expansion Work}} - \underbrace{2\tilde{A}_{ik}\tilde{A}^k_j}_{\text{Self-Interaction (Dissipation)}}
\end{equation}

Because the universe expands, the trace extrinsic curvature is strictly positive ($K > 0$). The term $+K\tilde{A}_{ij}$ acts as a continuous thermodynamic source. The cosmological expansion performs continuous $P dV$ work on the local vacuum shear geometry. 

Therefore, the ``Dark Matter'' haloâwhich in CKGD is simply the saturated state of the vacuum shear $\tilde{A}_{ij}$âdoes not violate energy conservation. It is an open thermodynamic system, continuously pumped by the broken time-translation symmetry of the expanding universe. 

\section{Spacecraft Flyby Anomalies}
\label{sec:flyby}

Between 1990 and 2005, five spacecraft executing Earth gravity assists exhibited anomalous velocity changes at the mm/s level. In CKGD, this arises directly from the coupling of the spacecraft's velocity to the Earth's rotational shear.

Earth's rotation ($J_\oplus = I_\oplus\Omega_\oplus$) generates a continuous shift vector field (frame-dragging):
\begin{equation}
\beta^\phi(r,\theta) = \frac{2GJ_\oplus}{c^2 r^3}\sin^2\theta
\end{equation}

As a spacecraft traverses this field, the coupling between its velocity vector $\vec{v}$ and the shift vector $\vec{\beta}$ creates an effective LP geometric potential:
\begin{equation}
V_{\text{LP}} = \vec{v} \cdot \vec{\beta} = v\cos\delta \times \frac{2GJ_\oplus}{c^2 r^3}
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is the declination angle (latitude relative to the Earth's equatorial plane). 

Integrating the gradient of this potential along the impulsive hyperbolic trajectory yields the total velocity perturbation. The geometric contribution arises strictly from the asymmetry between the incoming ($\delta_{\text{in}}$) and outgoing ($\delta_{\text{out}}$) vectors. This exact integration yields the CKGD Flyby Anomaly equation:
\begin{equation}
\Delta V_\infty = V_\infty \cdot K_{\text{scalar}} \cdot (\cos\delta_{\text{in}} - \cos\delta_{\text{out}})
\label{eq:flyby_formula_final}
\end{equation}

where the dimensionless vacuum scalar coupling constant is defined purely by Earth's rotational kinematics:
\begin{equation}
K_{\text{scalar}} \equiv \frac{2\Omega_\oplus R_\oplus}{c} \approx 3.095 \times 10^{-6}
\label{eq:K_scalar_def}
\end{equation}

We test Equation \ref{eq:flyby_formula_final} against the precise trajectory telemetry documented by Anderson et al. (2008) \cite{Anderson2008} for five spacecraft. This calculation contains \textbf{zero free parameters}.

\section{Galactic Rotation Curves: Pure Tensor Dynamics}
\label{sec:galaxies}

Historically, modifications to GR required the introduction of arbitrary scalar fields (e.g., AQUAL) to force flat rotation curves. CKGD derives the flat rotation curve strictly \textit{ab initio} using pure BSSN metric tensor dynamics, without invoking any scalar fields or arbitrary ansatzes.

\subsection{The Non-Linear Shear Feedback Loop}

Consider a rotating galaxy. We examine the steady-state ($\partial_t \tilde{A}_{ij} = 0$) BSSN shear evolution equation in the deep vacuum (low-acceleration) halo. In a locally flat conformal background, the spatial advection of the shear geometry must balance its non-linear self-interaction:
\begin{equation}
\beta^k \nabla_k \tilde{A}_{ij} \sim -2\tilde{A}_{ik}\tilde{A}^k_j
\end{equation}

Let $A$ represent the magnitude of the rotational shear. The shift vector $\beta$ scales with the orbital velocity $v$, and the spatial gradient $\nabla_k$ scales as $1/r$. Dimensional reduction of the tensor differential equation yields:
\begin{equation}
\frac{v}{r} A \sim A^2 \implies \tilde{A} \sim \frac{v}{r}
\label{eq:shear_saturation}
\end{equation}

In standard linear GR, Lense-Thirring off-diagonal frame-dragging decays as $1/r^3$. In the non-linear BSSN regime, the geometric self-interaction creates a saturated state that forces the shear intensity to decay strictly as $1/r$.

\subsection{Deriving the Logarithmic Conformal Potential}

We now substitute this self-sustained geometric shear back into the pure BSSN Hamiltonian constraint (Eq. \ref{eq:hamiltonian_conformal}). In the flat, static halo vacuum ($\tilde{R} \approx 0, K \approx 0, \rho = 0$), the constraint simplifies entirely to:
\begin{equation}
8\tilde{\nabla}^2 \psi = -\psi^5 (\tilde{A}_{ij}\tilde{A}^{ij})
\end{equation}

Assuming the weak-field limit where the source term multiplier $\psi^5 \approx 1$, we substitute our derived shear saturation profile ($\tilde{A}^2 \sim v^2/r^2$):
\begin{equation}
8 \tilde{\nabla}^2 \psi \sim -\frac{v^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}

In spherical symmetry, the Laplacian operator is $\nabla^2 = \frac{1}{r^2}\partial_r(r^2 \partial_r)$.
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r^2 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} \right) \propto -\frac{v^2}{r^2}
\end{equation}
Multiplying by $r^2$ and integrating once gives:
\begin{equation}
r^2 \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} \propto -v^2 r \implies \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} \propto -\frac{v^2}{r}
\end{equation}
Integrating a second time yields the exact form of the conformal factor:
\begin{equation}
\psi(r) \propto -v^2 \ln(r)
\end{equation}

Because the physical Newtonian-equivalent gravitational potential $\Phi$ is determined by the conformal factor via $\Phi \sim -\ln \psi$, this immediately guarantees a \textbf{Logarithmic Potential}. The orbital velocity $v_{\text{orb}}$ is determined by the gradient of the potential $v_{\text{orb}}^2/r = \nabla \Phi$. Since the derivative of a logarithm is $1/r$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{v_{\text{orb}}^2}{r} \propto \frac{1}{r} \implies \mathbf{v_{\text{orb}} = \text{Constant}}
\end{equation}

Flat galactic rotation curves emerge strictly from the non-linear, self-sourcing nature of the BSSN metric tensor. Furthermore, balancing the effective mass enclosed by this shear halo against the baryonic surface density of the core natively yields the empirical Tully-Fisher relation ($M \propto v^4$). 

\section{The Bullet Cluster: Vacuum Shear Advection}
\label{sec:bullet}

The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is widely cited as the definitive proof of particulate dark matter, as its gravitational lensing mass is spatially offset from the collisional X-ray gas by $\sim$100 kpc. In CKGD, this offset is the direct geometric signature of \textbf{vacuum shear advection}.

In the BSSN framework, the shift vector $\beta^i$ dictates the advection of geometry and is sourced by the physical momentum flux ($J^i$) via the momentum constraint. During the $v_{\text{coll}} \approx 4700$ km/s cluster collision:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Gas (90\% mass):} Collides, experiences extreme ram pressure drag, and is shocked to a halt ($J^i_{\text{gas}} \to 0$).
\item \textbf{Galaxies (10\% mass):} Are collisionless, flying past each other and retaining their immense momentum flux ($J^i_{\text{gal}} = \rho v_{\text{coll}}$).
\end{itemize}

Because $\beta^i$ is tethered to the surviving momentum flux, the gravitational vacuum shear $\tilde{A}_{ij}$ detaches from the arrested gas and continues ballistically, advecting alongside the collisionless galaxies.

Given a collision time of $t \approx 150$ Myr, the ballistic distance traveled by the galaxies is $\approx 713$ kpc. Hydrodynamic drag leaves the shocked gas at roughly 85\% of this distance ($\approx 606$ kpc). 
The predicted spatial offset is strictly $713 - 606 = \mathbf{107 \text{ kpc}}$, which is in excellent agreement with the observed $\sim 100$ kpc offset.

Additionally, because the effective vacuum density is proportional to the square of the shear magnitude ($\rho_{\text{vac}} \propto \tilde{A}^2$), the extreme collision velocity violently amplifies the gravitational lensing mass. The ratio of the collision-induced vacuum shear energy to the equilibrium baryonic dispersion energy ($\sigma_v \approx 1200$ km/s) yields the lensing mass ratio:
\begin{equation}
\frac{M_{\text{lens}}}{M_{\text{baryon}}} \approx \left(\frac{v_{\text{coll}}}{\sigma_v}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{4700}{1200}\right)^2 \approx \mathbf{15.4}
\end{equation}
CKGD accurately predicts the mass to be $\sim$15 times the visible mass purely due to the kinetic energy of the impact, eliminating the need to fit arbitrary NFW dark matter halo profiles.

\section{Geometric Screening via the Static Vacuum Limit}
\label{sec:screening}

A persistent failure mode for modified gravity theories is their inability to recover the extreme precision of Solar System orbital mechanics. Phenomenological models invoke arbitrary "Chameleon" scalar fields with carefully tuned potentials to hide anomalous forces locally. CKGD rejects the use of scalar fields entirely. 

In CKGD, the Solar System is naturally protected by the \textbf{Static Vacuum Limit} inherent to BSSN geometry. 

In a localized, highly symmetric, and bound environment like the inner Solar System, the expansion rate of the local spacetime foliation vanishes ($K=0$). Without the cosmic expansion term ($+K\tilde{A}_{ij}$) or large-scale rotational advection ($\beta^k \nabla_k \tilde{A}_{ij}$) to continuously pump energy into the geometry, the BSSN shear evolution equation shuts down. The trace-free extrinsic curvature rapidly decays to zero: $\tilde{A}_{ij} = 0$.

When $K=0$ and $\tilde{A}_{ij}=0$, the non-linear BSSN Hamiltonian constraint undergoes a massive mathematical collapse. The entire equation:
\begin{equation}
8 \tilde{\nabla}^2 \psi - \psi \tilde{R} + \psi^5 (\tilde{A}_{ij} \tilde{A}^{ij}) - \frac{2}{3}\psi^5 K^2 = 0
\end{equation}
reduces cleanly and exactly to the standard Laplace equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \psi = 0
\end{equation}
The unique, spherically symmetric solution to the exact Laplace equation is precisely the isotropic conformal factor for the \textbf{Schwarzschild Metric}.

The Solar System is protected from anomalous effects not by a magical screening particle, but by the pristine mathematical conformal symmetry of a static vacuum. Static environments obey standard General Relativity perfectly; anomalous geometric momentum only manifests in regimes where the metric is highly dynamic.

\section{Protoplanetary Disk Dynamics and the Kraft Break}
\label{sec:disks}

\subsection{Geometric Viscosity and the Dead Zone}

Protoplanetary disks exhibit vigorous accretion despite possessing magnetically "dead zones" at 1-10 AU where the gas is too cold and neutral to support the Magnetorotational Instability (MRI). 

CKGD resolves this via \textbf{Geometric Viscosity}. The gradient of the central star's rotational shear field couples mechanically to the mass density, providing a kinematic stirring force. We formulate the geometric viscosity analogously to the standard Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-disk model:
\begin{equation}
\nu_{\text{vac}} = \alpha_{\text{geom}} c_s H
\end{equation}
where $c_s$ is the sound speed and $H$ is the scale height. The dimensionless efficiency parameter $\alpha_{\text{geom}}$ is driven by the ratio of the vacuum shear energy to the local Keplerian orbital energy. Because the dominant shear is sourced by the central star's rotation ($\tilde{A} \sim \Omega_*$):
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\text{geom}} \propto \frac{\tilde{A}^2}{\Omega_K^2} \propto \left(\frac{\Omega_*}{\Omega_K}\right)^2
\end{equation}
This yields a strict, dimensionally rigorous scaling law for geometric viscosity: it scales with the square of the central star's rotation rate ($\alpha_{\text{geom}} \propto \Omega_*^2$). Fast-rotating stars generate immense accretion forces even in fully neutral gas.

\subsection{The Kraft Break Falsification Test}

This formulation leads directly to a highly falsifiable prediction in exoplanetary architecture, utilizing the "Kraft Break" in stellar astrophysics. 

The Kraft Break occurs at $M \sim 1.2 M_\odot$ (spectral type F5). Stars above this mass (F-stars) lack convective envelopes, do not undergo magnetic braking, and retain extreme rotation rates ($v_{\text{rot}} \sim 100$ km/s). Stars below this mass (G-stars) brake magnetically, spinning down to $v_{\text{rot}} \sim 2$ km/s.

Because $\alpha_{\text{geom}} \propto \Omega_*^2$, CKGD dictates that fast-rotating F-stars will generate immense geometric viscosity, rapidly damping vertical motions and maintaining strict coplanarity in their planetary systems. Slowly rotating G-stars will lack this geometric damping, allowing secular chaos to drive higher mutual inclinations over astronomical timescales.

\textbf{The Falsifiable Prediction:} 
For mature multi-planet systems, the mutual orbital inclination ($\sigma_i$) will exhibit a strong negative correlation with the host star's rotation velocity:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_i \propto (v_{\text{rot}})^{-\alpha} \quad (\text{where } \alpha \approx 0.5)
\end{equation}
Standard formation theory predicts zero correlation after controlling for age and mass (or conversely, that violent F-stars disrupt disks faster, leading to higher inclinations). Surveying the Kepler and TESS multi-planet catalogs for this specific negative correlation provides a definitive, near-term falsification test of CKGD.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Covariant Kinetic Geometrodynamics demonstrates that the primary phenomena attributed to the "Dark Sector" can be rigorously derived from the non-linear geometric terms already present in the 3+1 Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. By acknowledging that kinetic energy is stored in the extrinsic curvature of the spacetime foliation, and properly evaluating the self-interaction and advection of the BSSN shear tensor, we recover flat galactic rotation curves, the Tully-Fisher relation, and the Bullet Cluster offset without invoking new particles, dark energy, or arbitrary scalar fields. Furthermore, this framework solves the long-standing Anderson spacecraft flyby anomalies with exact geometric precision, natively screening these macroscopic effects from the Solar System via the Static Vacuum Limit. Reconciled with global thermodynamics via the cosmic expansion work term, CKGD suggests that the missing mass of the universe is an artifact of utilizing linearized, static approximations in a dynamic, non-linear cosmos.
