Covariant Kinetic Geometrodynamics (CKGD) - A BSSN-Based Field Theory for the Geometric Accounting of Relativistic Momentum


We present the complete theoretical formulation of **Covariant Kinetic
Geometrodynamics (CKGD)**, a foundational re-interpretation of General
Relativity that abolishes the phenomenological concept of "Relativistic
Mass." We postulate the **Lorentz Perceptron Hypothesis**: that the
Lorentz factor $\gamma$ represents a frame-dependent geometric shearing
of the spacetime manifold ($\tilde{A}_{ij}$) rather than an intrinsic
alteration of matter. To rigorously validate this, we employ the (3+1)
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition to isolate the "Kinetic
Geometry," and subsequently upgrade to the
Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formalism to ensure strong
hyperbolicity and numerical stability in the ultra-relativistic limit.
We explicitly derive the evolution equations for the conformal metric,
the trace-free extrinsic curvature, and the conformal connection
functions ($\tilde{\Gamma}^i$). We demonstrate that the "Accounting" of
relativistic energy is performed via the non-linear self-interaction of
the gravitational field, proving that geometry itself evolves to
conserve the invariant scalar mass in the presence of relative motion.
